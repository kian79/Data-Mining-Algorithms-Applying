# Data-Mining-Algorithms-Applying
In this repository I added some of my projects in which I applied data mining algorithms on some open source databases. The algorithms are listed below.

* Iris Dimentionality Reduction
* Classification with Neural Network
* Clustering Algorithms
* Association Rules

## Iris Dimentionality Reduction
The goal of this project was to apply some preprocessing tools on IRIS dataset and then reduce its dimention using PCA. 
In the pre-processing phase of this project I did the following actions:
* Dropped null rows.
* Used label encoder to convert categorical feature to numerical feature.
* Normalized data using standart scaler.
* Applied PCA to reduce the number of features to 2.
* Plot the output dataframe to see the changes.

## Classification using Neural Network
In this project I trained a neural network using Keras library. To emphadize the effect of different variables of the neural network, it was trained step by step. You can see the steps in the following lines.
* Neural network trained without any activation function. The result is very bas as expected.
